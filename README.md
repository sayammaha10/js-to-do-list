# To-Do List Web App

This is a simple and interactive To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, marking as complete, and removing tasks. The app also features data persistence using `localStorage` to save tasks even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input and add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Toggle tasks between completed and pending with a strikethrough effect.
- **Remove Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking a delete icon.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves tasks to `localStorage` so they persist after a page refresh.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the to-do list and input form.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For functionality like adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed, as well as saving tasks to `localStorage`.
